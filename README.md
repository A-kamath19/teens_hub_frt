# Aim:
Teenage is a delicate phase where children go through changes within (hormonal and physical)and around (stepping out of school and deciding about further education). Most children find it difficult to cope with these changes. They often feel misunderstood or not understood, which leads to frustration. They battle with trust issues, money management, communication with parents and friends, goal setting and so much more.
Teens hub is a support group for teenagers in the age group of 13 to 19 years. It is a self-help initiative by a couple of enthusiastic teenagers that had the opportunity to moderate. It remains a self-help platform, where teenagers gather to understand and support one another. In the process, each participant understands himself or herself better. It is a community that facilitates non-judgmental exchange of ideas. The objective is to allow teenagers to blossom into sensitive and successful young adults.
